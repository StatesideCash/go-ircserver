# go-ircserver
A simple IRC server written in Go.
I am making a simple IRC server to practice Go. This is mainly just for fun. I
am making it according to RFC1459 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459)

# TODO
- SSL sockets
- Choose which interface to bind to
- Hash user passwords
- IPv6
- USER and SERVER commands
